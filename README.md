Promotional Restaruant Payment System using Blockchain Technologies
## Introduction
In recent decades, an increasing number of people dining out has caused the restaurant industry in Hong Kong to rapidly grown up, which has brought about a fierce competition between restaurant owners promoting their restaurants by introducing a new menu, offering discounts for meal deals or some coupons in order to attract customers and encourage their future visits, which, however, does not seem effective enough to convert such a floating population into the actual payments.

Not only that, a daily fluctuation in the number of visits for different timeslots unique to the food service industry has been a nuisance to restaurant hosts in the determination of the number of employees to be hired for serving as well as the estimation of waiting times for ordering, which is a key determinant of the quality of service.

From an idea of membership subscriptions provided by credit card issuers, which enable card holders to enjoy a discount in multiple restaurants in partnership at a cost of paying monthly fees, in this paper, we propose a new payment system based on blockchain technologies which not only simplifies the traditional ordering procedures, to a great extent, along with the real-time order tracking and cancellation but also provides a consensus-driven platform for restaurant owners to design cooperative and location-based discount promotion schemes on their own without the need of external payment agents.

Such joint discount offers would be economically appealing to customers, particulary, some of whom are on a tight budget, having no choice but to regularly dine out for reasons of the time constraint and therefore suffering from the acculumlation of dining fees, which would eventually become a win- win solution for both parties.
